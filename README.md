# CineCache
##### Project1-Group13

This application allows the user to either use their current location, or input a zip code in order to generate a list of the movies playing in the immediate vicinity.  Then the user can select a particular movie to view the specifics for, at which point in time the information for that film as well as a listing of all the times that movie is playing for the rest of the day, along with accompanying theater information and links to purchase tickets are also displayed.  Additionally the YouTube API is queried and videos/trailers pertaining to the film selected are displayed.  The app is fully mobile-ready for any size device.
